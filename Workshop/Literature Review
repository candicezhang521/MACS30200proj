Currently there have been many articles talking about the determining factors of businesses’ success. However, there aren’t many research that studies why businesses’ fail. More specifically, what factors will lead to restaurant close? There has been one article that talked about why business fail. The researcher concluded that location, affiliation and size are three important factors. However, the researcher did not talk about to what degree do these three factors impact restaurant fail. The lack of detailed lack of detailed research on restaurant close leads to my research question, which is how do the mechanisms of food, location and ambience impact the closing of restaurants that got their license in 2012 in Chicago area.

From one research on online reviews, 82 percent of respondents say their purchase decisions have been directly influenced by online reviews. Currently, Yelp is the most popular online consumer review website used for local business reviews and recommendations. According to a research on Yelp, A one star increase in Yelp rating leads to a 5-9 percent increase in revenue. All these research on consumer reviews as well as on yelp show that each piece of text reviews is more than just a sentence. For this research, I am going to do a text analysis on these reviews and explore the interplay of the my three matter of interest on restaurant close. The method I’m going to use is mostly from Natural Language Toolkit, including POS Tagging, sentiment analysis, etc.
